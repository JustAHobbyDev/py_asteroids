# Py_steroids

My version of the old school game Asteroids using Python and Pygame

How to play:
- Move with `[W,A,S,D]`
- Shoot with `SPACE`
- Use power ups to:
  - Recover life
  - Upgrade weapon
  - Gain shield
  - Boost speed

Compete for the top score (with yourself :P)

At the game over, hit `Esc` to finish your play session or enter to start another game and beat the best score you got so far :)

Hope you have a great time reviving this old game with my own perks!


Things to add(suggestions):
- [ ] Add bombs that can be dropped
